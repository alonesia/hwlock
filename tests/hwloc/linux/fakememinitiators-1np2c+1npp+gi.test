# complex initiators/targets
# one node per pair of core and one per 4-core package.
# All nodes are either cpu-only (0-3) or memory-only (5-10)
# Hence we have to hide CPU-only nodes and find the locality of memory nodes
# using sysfs target/initiator files.
# There's also a generic initiator (node4) that has faster access
# to memory node5/6/7 than its local CPU.
# It doesn't appear in our topology but forces us to use access1 instead of access0.
