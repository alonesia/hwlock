# fake linux example
# heterogeneous NUMA locations:
# - NUMA nodes at different levels and even some above others.
# - Intented to regression test the inserting/management of nodes and nodesets in the core
#   even if real machines didn't expose such things yet.
# and heterogenous frequencies for cpukinds.
# Also used in test-hwloc-calc and test-hwloc-info.
