# lots of heterogeneous memories:
# Package0 has DRAM+HBM+NVM but HBM is exposed as DAX (SPM instead of HBM since DAX have no BW info).
# Package1 has DRAM+2xHBM+NVM but one HBM is as DAX (SPM instead of HBM).
# Package2 has HBM+2xNVM but one NVM is as DAX (NVM).
# See commit 526cdf1b7fc87f1f4a3b1e14d675139d65342681 for Qemu configuration and later tweaks.
